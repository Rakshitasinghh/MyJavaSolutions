Time Complexity:

Linear Search:
- Best: O(1)
- Avg/Worst: O(n)

Binary Search:
- Best: O(1)
- Avg/Worst: O(log n) 

better?
- Binary Search is faster for large sorted datasets (O(log n)).
- Linear Search is simpler and better for small or unsorted data.

In real-world e-commerce:
- Products are usually indexed & sorted -> Binary Search (or even better: Hashing, Trees, or Databases).
